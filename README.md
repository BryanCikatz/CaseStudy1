# MSDS 6306: Introduction to Data Science (403)

# CaseStudy1

# Due: June 30, 2017 (Friday)

Submit the link to the ﬁle in GitHub via the space provided for in the Case Study 01 page in 2DS.

Instructions Deliverable: Markdown ﬁle uploaded to GitHub containing the following

a. Introduction to the project. The introduction should not start with For my project I .

b. The introduction needs to be written as if you are presenting the work to someone who has given you the data to analyze and wants to understand the result. In other words, pretend its not a case study for a course. Pretend its a presentation for a client.

c. Brief explanations of the purpose of the code. The explanations should appear as a sentence or two before or after the code chunk. Even though you will not be hiding the code chunks (so that I can see the code), you need to pretend that the client cant see them.

d. Code to answer the seven questions above (plus the answers) in the same R Markdown ﬁle.

e. Clear answers to the questions. Just the code to answer the questions is not enough, even if the code is correct and gives the correct answer. You must state the answer in a complete sentence outside the code chunk.

f. Conclusion to the project. Summarize your ﬁndings from this exercise. The ﬁle must be readable in GitHub. In other words, dont forget to keep the md ﬁle!!


Note

R Markdown ﬁles often do not render graphics and output from R Markdown chunks in GitHub. Keep the MD (markdown) ﬁle and upload it along with the R Markdown ﬁle.
